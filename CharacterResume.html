<h3>About Me</h3>
After the outbreak of World War II in Europe, a young American patriot named Steve Rogers was inspired to serve his country by joining the United States Army. When he attempted to enlist Steve was rejected, due to his skinny, whimpy physique, and was classified as a failure. However, he garnered the attention of certain people including scientist Doctor Abraham Erskine who was searching for suitable volunteers/test subjects for a top secret experimental program designed to create an army of super-soldiers. As a result of Operation: Rebirth, Steve Rogers gained speed, strength, flexibility, endurance and agility of nearly superhuman levels. These heightened abilities coupled with his unwavering courage and “never say die” attitude eventually made him Captain America, a living legend.
